This Ansible playbook will:

1. Update the package cache
2. Install necessary prerequisites
3. Add Kubernetes repositories and install Kubernetes components
4. Initialize a Kubernetes cluster
5. Install the Calico network plugin
6. Add NVIDIA GPU repositories and install NVIDIA drivers and container toolkit
7. Configure containerd for NVIDIA GPU support
8. Install the NVIDIA device plugin for Kubernetes
9. Label the node for NVIDIA GPU

To use this playbook:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., ```kubernetes-nvidia-playbook.yml```
2. Ensure you have Ansible installed on your control machine
3. Update your Ansible inventory file with the target Ubuntu 22.04 server(s)
4. Run the playbook with: ```ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file kubernetes-nvidia-playbook.yml```

This playbook assumes you're running it on a ```single-node cluster```. For a multi-node cluster, you'd need to adjust the playbook to separate master and worker node tasks.

Also, please be aware that the NVIDIA driver version (525 in this playbook) might need to be adjusted based on your specific GPU model and requirements.
