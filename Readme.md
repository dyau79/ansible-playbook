This Ansible playbook will perform the following tasks:

```
-Update the apt cache
-Install required system packages
-Add Docker GPG key and repository
-Install Docker
-Add Kubernetes GPG key and repository
-Install Kubernetes packages (kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl)
-Prevent Kubernetes packages from being automatically updated
-Restart and enable Docker service
-Enable and start kubelet service
```
To use this playbook:

Save it to a file, for example, kubernetes_install.yml
Make sure you have Ansible installed on your control node
Update your Ansible inventory file with the target Ubuntu 22.04 servers
Run the playbook with the command: ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file kubernetes_install.yml

Note that this playbook installs the necessary components but does not configure a Kubernetes cluster. After running this playbook, you'll need to initialize your Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm init on the master node and join worker nodes to the cluster.
